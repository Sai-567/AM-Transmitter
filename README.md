# AM-Transmitter
This MATLAB project simulates an AM radio transmitter that records an audio signal, modulates it onto a high-frequency carrier wave, and analyzes its spectrum. The script includes real-time microphone input, modulation index calculation, power analysis, signal visualization, and audio playback.
